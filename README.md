# CSC2516-FinalProject
Neural Networks and Deep Learning Final Project This library is based on [lightning-toolbox](https://github.com/vahidzee/lightning-toolbox) which we partly developed in parallel to enable dynamic training procedures, and model designs in our experiments.

## Possible Experiments
- Leave-one-out class MNIST
- Leave-one-out class CIFAR
- Train on all classes, corrupt images for inference CIFAR and MNIST
- Explore scaling of AE depth and width
- Treate one class as normal and rest of classes as anomoalous
